        "I saw a reel on Instagram in which an AI enthusiast created an AI clone of himself to talk to his girlfriend (Certainly, I won't do that... xd) using [RAG](https://youtu.be/YVWxbHJakgg?feature=shared) Retrieval Augmented Generation and the Chat GPT-3.5 turbo API. It kind of worked, but it had major privacy issues. Sending personal chats to Chat GPT could potentially result in those chats being used by OpenAI to train its model. This led me to think, what if I fine-tuned a pre-existing model like Llama or Mixtral on my personal WhatsApp chat history? It would be cool to have a model that can talk like me as I do on WhatsApp, primarily in Hinglish (Hindi + English).\n",

        "[Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM)](https://youtu.be/YVWxbHJakgg?feature=shared) requires a good understanding of LLMs in general. The major challenge with fine-tuning big models, such as a 7B parameter model, is that it requires a minimum of 32GB of GPU RAM, which is costly and not available in free-tier GPU compute services like Colab or Kaggle. So, I had to find a way around this limitation.\n",
